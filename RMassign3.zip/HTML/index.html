    <hr>
    <P>
        Hello! My name is Ray Moo. This is my first year at PCC. Before that, I attended Western Governors University
        (WGU). It
        was a great school, but I later realized that online schooling wasn't the best fit for me, so I'm here, excited
        to
        explore a different learning environment at PCC.
    </P>
    <p>
        When I'm not in school, studying, or working, you'll find me indulging myself in anime, reading novels, and
        going on a
        hike or working out at the gym. One of the hobbies I'm eager to explore is learning to play classical guitar, as
        the
        harmonious melodies have always fascinated me, and I'm excited to embark on this musical journey in my free
        time.
        I enjoy Working out at the gym, it keeps me physically fit but also provides a much-needed break from the mental
        demands
        of daily life, allowing me to recharge and stay energized for my other interests and pursuits.</p>
